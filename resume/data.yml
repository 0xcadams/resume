  # Architected two
  # Jenkins build pipelines, one of which uses Git and Maven to build Docker containers for upload to
  # Amazon ECR, and sped up the build time from over 8 hours to 4 hours. Constructed an integration test
  # framework based on JUnit for testing Docker containers running Spring Boot in a restricted AWS
  # environment, which reports results to Slack. Implemented OAuth 1.0a for API authentication to allow
  # other Infor products to access the service. Assisted team members with the transition from SVN/Skype
  # to Git/Slack, by reviewing pull requests and answering questions.
